Admittedly, I have a bad habit of wandering and subsequently making something beautiful from it.

I studied politics, economics, religion, and all other initially-taboo topics of conversation at [Pomona College](pomona.edu "47"). After graduation I worked as a foreign language educator abroad and at home; I also fought for education-access with an NGO as a program coordinator.

I went back to school to study econometrics and international development towards a Master's of Science in Foreign Service at [Georgetown](https://msfs.georgetown.edu/).

I then discovered open-source data science at the World Bank, where I was lucky enough to be mentored as a creative, collaborative, and curious developer.

I speak English, Spanish, Japanese, and sometimes, Italian. I code in R, Stata, sometimes in Python, Julia, and soon in Rust ðŸ˜„

My current interests are post-humanism, singularity studies, sustainable urban transit, running, and wherever Kevin Durant is playing. I eat a plant-based diet; and I bike everywhere.
